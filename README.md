🌀 Pattern Playground – Star & Number Hourglass 🌀

Welcome to Pattern Playground! A fun little repo where loops, stars, numbers, and brain gymnastics collide. 🤹‍♂️

Here, we explore:

Number Hourglass Patterns – where digits shrink and stretch across spaces.

Star (Hollow) Hourglass Patterns – classic pyramids flipped into the mysterious hourglass.

Hollow and Solid Variations – control your stars with nst and spaces with nsp.

🚀 Why This Repo Rocks

Loops on Loops – nested loops mastered one row at a time.

Logical Thinking – deciding where stars/numbers appear versus where spaces hide.

Preparation for DSA – sharpen your loop, conditional, and dry-run intuition.

Fun and Funky – pattern printing isn’t just for fun; it’s for brain training too.

🛠 Patterns Included
Type	Description
Number Hourglass	Numbers shrink row by row with spaces in between.
Star (Hollow) Hourglass	Hollow star hourglass with top/bottom solid rows.
Solid Star Hourglass	Classic solid hourglass for visual impact.
Mixed Variations	Experiment with hollow, solid, and number combinations.
📝 How It Works

All patterns are coded using:

nst → Number of stars (or numbers) per row.

nsp → Number of leading spaces per row.

Conditional Checks → Decide when to print stars, numbers, or spaces.

Loops Only → No fancy libraries, just pure C logic.
⚡ Fun Fact

Patterns like these don’t just look cool—they train your brain for recursion, pointers, and even DSA problem-solving.
Think of it as “push-ups for your coding muscles.” 💪

🤩 Contributions

Add your own number/letter/star patterns.

Try mirrored diamonds, butterflies, or even alphabet hourglass.

Make it funky, make it challenging, and make it yours.
